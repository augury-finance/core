# Augury Finance

Welcome to Augury Finance!

This repository contains the OMEN Token as well as our `MasterAugur` and Strategies that we will run on the platform.

Additionally, we have included our `Timelock` here, which is a fork from compound.finance

The `OMEN` token contains governance information so that eventually our community can govern itself.


## Security

Migrator functionality has been removed. Augury Finance cannot migrate your funds.

For your protection, fees introduced in the Strategies have limits. The starting deposit fee is 4% and there are no withdrawal fees (0%).

The `emergencyWithdraw()` method on `MasterAugur` has been included so that you can call this directly through the Mainnet. For details on this, please visit our Gitbook!

On the `mainnet` This contract is to be owned by our `Timelock`.
